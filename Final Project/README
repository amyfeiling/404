# Color Selector Browser Extension

This browser extension is for changing the background and foreground colors of web pages. It only changes background and foreground colors of web pages that don't have specific CSS already defined by name or id tags. The idea behind this browser extension is to be a guide for anyone who wants to change color choices of a web page.
